# 🎬 ReactFlix

**ReactFlix** is a modern **movie web application** built as part of my React.js practice.  
It uses **Firebase Authentication** and **TMDB APIs** to provide real movie data, trailers, and a smooth user experience with animations and sliders.

The project also includes a **Forgot Password** feature, which is often missing in many beginner React projects.
